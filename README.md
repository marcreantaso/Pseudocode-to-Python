# PseudoPy — Automated Code Generation System

> **Bridging Pseudocode and Python: An Algorithmic Approach to Automated Code Generation**

A web-based system that translates pseudocode into executable Python code, built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with full mobile responsiveness.

## ✨ Features

- **Pseudocode-to-Python Translation Engine** — Rule-based converter supporting IF/ELSE, FOR, WHILE, FUNCTION, SET, DISPLAY, and more
- **In-Browser Code Execution** — Run Python directly in the browser via Skulpt
- **Feedback & Suggestions** — Analyze pseudocode for structure, syntax balance, and quality
- **Role-Based Access** — Student, Instructor, and Admin dashboards
- **Exercise Management** — Instructors create exercises, students practice pseudocode
- **Learning Analytics** — Track submissions, success rates, and common errors
- **PWA Support** — Installable on Android and iOS, works offline
- **Fully Responsive** — Optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Using Node.js http-server
